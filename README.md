This project is to demonstrate the detection and traking using opencv and deep learning concepts.

This project require the knowledge of C++ and opencv libraries. Apart from this it also requires some knowledge 
to use deep learning modules.

To build the project you just need to usage cmake in the code directory and it will compile if you have 
setup the path of opencv installtion coorectly in the CMakeLists.txt.

Once the project is compiled it will generate a binary named DetectionAndTracking

Before running the output you need to download and copy yolov3.weights inside data/models/ 

Now you can run this from commandline using ./DetectionAndTracking on Linux terminal

You can contact me on my email in case you face any issue.
